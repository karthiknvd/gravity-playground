# 🌌 Gravity Playground

Live Demo → **[https://gravity-playground.vercel.app](https://gravity-playground.vercel.app)**

A tiny little **gravity toy** I made for fun.
Move your mouse and watch particles go **zoom**, **spin**, **orbit**, or completely **lose their mind**.

No frameworks, no libraries — just **HTML canvas + JavaScript chaos**.

---

## ✨ What This Is

Basically:

* a bunch of glowing particles
* your mouse acts like a gravity source
* each gravity mode has its own personality
* everything reacts instantly
* and sometimes physics just gives up 💀

It’s a fun experiment, nothing too serious.
Just vibes, motion, and accidental black holes.

## 🎮 Gravity Modes (Fun Descriptions)

### 🟦 **Planet**

Chill mode.
Particles orbit nicely like they’re following rules.

### ⭐ **Star**

Same as Planet but more energetic.
Particles have Red Bull now.

### 🕳 **Black Hole**

Things get dramatic.
Spiral… pull… collapse… repeat.

### ⚡ **Insane**

No rules. No peace. Only speed.

### 💥 **Rupture**

The universe glitches.
Particles shake, reverse direction, flicker, and sometimes break time itself.
Not scientifically approved.

## 🖱 Controls

* **Move mouse** → Gravity happens
* **1 – 5 keys** → Switch between modes
* **Click buttons** → Same thing but with style
* **Leave the screen** → Particles get abandoned 😔

## 🧪 Why I Made This

* Was bored
* Wanted to make something cool
* Love particles
* Love chaos
* That’s it.

It turned into a surprisingly satisfying toy.

## 🎨 How It Looks

Particles with glow, trails, smooth motion, and occasional panic.
Very therapeutic (except rupture mode).

## 🛠 Customize It!

Things you can mess with in `script.js`:

* Particle count
* Glow color palette
* Gravity strength
* Orbital behavior
* Chaos intensity
* Create new gravity modes

Break the universe however you want.
